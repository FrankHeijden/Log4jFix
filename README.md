# ⚠️DEPRECATION⚠️
Mojang has now released client updates, making this plugin obsolete. Make sure to **fully** restart your client. If you haven't already **update** your backend servers -- only updating your server jars will fix the exploit. Join the [paper discord](https://discord.gg/papermc) and read the pins in `#paper-help`. 

# Log4jFix
Fixes the log4j exploit from reaching connected Minecraft clients.

## Building it yourself
Inside the `log4jfix-velocity/` folder, create a subfolder called `libs`.
Download and place the velocity-proxy jar in that folder and modify `log4jfix-velocity/build.gradle.kts` accordingly.
